--Implement a function which takes a list and returns the number of numeric characters in
the list. Try to solve this question in two different ways, one with recursion and one with list
comprehension.

import Data.Char (isDigit)

countNumbersR []=0
countNumbersR (x:xs)= if isDigit x==True
                       then 1+countNumbersR xs
                     else
                       countNumbers xs


countNumbersC x=length [xs|xs<-x,isDigit xs]
